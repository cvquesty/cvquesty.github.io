  <div class="entry-content"><p>Somewhere in the back recesses of my mind, I was brewing a post about permissioning and the relationship between DEV and Sysadmin teams and when and how elevated access should be granted.</p>

<p>Well, Kyle over at <a href="http://serverfault.com">serverfault.com</a> has approached this topic in a post entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/893001713/should-developers-have-access-to-production">Should Developers Have Access to Production</a>?&rdquo;.  I highly recommend this read, as it covers many of the topics I wished to cover.  I do have some additional commentary, but I&rsquo;ll circle back around to that and share my thoughts at a later time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oftentimes I peruse various support forums and IRC channels.  Not for support, and not always to help out, but to just observe the community in action.</p>

<p>I have occasion to see the best of what Linux is all about (as it pertains to community), people literally all over the world at all levels of development asking for and giving help on a wide array of issues with their systems from very basic unix navigation and installation issues to extremely complicated configuration issues that require no less than code modification and custom compilation of new device drivers.</p>

<p>In and among this crucible of collaboration I find an almost pernicious insinuation to the conversation.  Whether it be because of youth, undeveloped social skills,  or some other societal construct, you begin to find those who are there for the sole purpose of detracting from the conversation.  Taking pot-shots and newcomers, ridiculing marginally experienced recent-converts and even getting into heavy argumentation regarding matters of practice in administration and or management of Linux systems.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, these find it a jolly good time to detract from the conversation; to make themselves present for little more than obstruction.  This can (and does) have a chilling effect on the community.</p>

<p>First, the open nature of the community is compromised.  Newcomers experience a chilling effect in not wishing to ask questions and interact for fear of being ridiculed and condescended toward.  Next, it generates a conversation away from these support channels about the character of those in the community, that they are elitist and snobbish in their assistance, and they wish not to help, but to lord over you their level of attainment.  Many times these conversations end with the phrase &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just stick with Windows, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Too bad for the community.</p>

<p>Widespread adoption of our beloved OS will not see any significant amount of growth until we move beyond this practice.  In light of this situation, I have some suggestions for community participants to both help them obtain the sense of community they wish and still allowing the newcomer to have a good experience, thus enjoying Linux early on, and then in turn propagating our community to his circle of friends.</p>

<p>First, if you must hang around Linux support forums, be prepared to answer any and all questions <strong>no matter how dumb you personally believe them to be. </strong> Remember that we all started at ground zero at some point in our lives.  We had those who helped us, and we had to pore through tons of documentation to get up to speed.  Show some understanding and compassion for the newcomer, and help them as much as you can.  If you do this regularly, before you know it, those &ldquo;newbs&rdquo; are now helping others only slightly newer than themselves with the very issues they themselves have just dealt with.</p>

<p>This does two things.  First, it brings them much higher in the food chain, making them closer to your level and much easier to relate to.  Next, it places yet another level of support for newcomers where you used to help out.  This is an optimal situation.  It broadens the community, &ldquo;pays it forward&rdquo; through newcomers to even newer adherents, and then builds up the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Next, if you don&rsquo;t have anything to offer, say, or help with, it is perfectly ok to shut up.  If you see a question that you really feel is stupid and you are running over the litany of wonderfully snarky things you can say, maybe it is just best that you not say anything at all.  I firmly believe this benefits everyone.  If you must type something, private message an online friend instead so you can have a private laugh together.</p>

<p>Finally, when you do have things to offer, remember that as users we have preconceived notions about what everyone &ldquo;should just know&rdquo;.  The fact of the matter is that everyone does&rsquo;t &ldquo;just know&rdquo; those things, and will never learn them if they&rsquo;re the butt of finely crafted barbs heading their way.  Be prepared to remediate in a very friendly, non-condescending way and be prepared to even go as far as &ldquo;Ok, a shell interprets the commands you type on the screen.&rdquo;  Or even (God forbid) &ldquo;your keyboard and/or mouse is sometimes referred to as input whereas your screen, network card, or modem is considered output.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Painful, I know, but the more friendly, welcoming, and helpful you are, you play a part in helping to build up the community in a way that is self-perpetuating.  Help out.  Be friendly.  <strong>Be patient</strong>.  With a little help and a little patience, you build a group of community members that one day will be doing the very same thing for another generation of users.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your handy LDAP server authenticating users for login throughout your environment, inevitably you find yourself getting around to the question of authentication for all your backend tools/services machines.  Can you authenticate from Apache to that same auth store to reduce administration burden across the environment?</p>

<p>Yes you can.</p>

<p>Recall from part I of this series that we have a server that is serving auth for our mythical &ldquo;Bob.com&rdquo; environment.  Recall also the important info regarding this environment:</p>

<p>Internet domain name:                   bob.com
hostname of the server:                   ldap.bob.com
LDAP Search base:                          dc=bob,dc=com</p>

<p>File:  /etc/openldap/ldap.conf</p>

<p>#</p>

<h1>LDAP Defaults</h1>

<p>#</p>

<p>BASE dc=bob,dc=com
URI ldap://ldap.bob.com
TLS_CACERTDIR /etc/openldap/cacerts</p>

<p>Now, we add to the mix an Apache web server that has an area it wants to secure.  Instead of using the old htpasswd method to create a disk-file containing usernames and password hashes, it would make much more sense to simply point Apache&rsquo;s authentication system at our shiny new LDAP server so we eliminate yet another user/pass system we have to administer.</p>

<p><strong>Apache</strong></p>

<p>As many of you are already aware, Apache offers simple authentication to allow/disallow access to specific shared directories over the web.  The Apache Project has detailed documentation to help you get started <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/auth.html">here</a>. I&rsquo;ll cover the basics here.</p>

<p>Traditionally, in Apache&rsquo;s config file(s) you specify a directory you wish to have secured via the &ldquo;Directory&rdquo; directive like so:</p>

<blockquote>

> 
> <Directory "/super/secret/directory">
> 
> 

> 
> AllowOverride None
> 
> 

> 
> Options ExecCGI Includes
> 
> 

> 
> Order allow,deny
> 
> 

> 
> Allow from all
> 
> 

> 
> AuthUserFile /secure/passwd/file/location
> 
> 

> 
> AuthType Basic
> 
> 

> 
> AuthName "Cool Security Name"
> 
> 

> 
> Require valid-user
> 
> 

> 
> </Directory>
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>You then create your passwd file for Apache with the htpasswd utility, make sure the above path points to it, bounce Apache, and you&rsquo;re authenticating locally.  Problem with this is that every time you need to add a new user to your environment, every instance like this has to be touched individually and you have to add the user (whether by copy/paste or otherwise is irrelevant) in each.</p>

<p>Enter LDAP.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the configuration for such a change is quite easy; Simple textual changes to the httpd.conf to repoint from the local disk file to the LDAP store is all you need.  First, make sure that your LDAP modules are properly loaded into Apache:</p>

<p>LoadModule ldap_module modules/mod_ldap.so</p>

<p>LoadModule authnz_ldap_module modules/mod_authnz_ldap.so</p>

<p>This tells the Apache core to load up these at startup so that the directives you supply in the Directory stanza will be understood.  Next, let&rsquo;s add the appropriate info into the Directory section:</p>

<p><Directory "/super/secret/directory"></p>

<p>AllowOverride None</p>

<p>Options ExecCGI Includes</p>

<p>Order deny,allow</p>

<p>Deny from all</p>

<p>AuthName &ldquo;Cool Security Name&rdquo;</p>

<p>AuthType Basic</p>

<p>AuthBasicProvider ldap</p>

<p>AuthzLDAPAuthoritative Off</p>

<p>AuthLDAPURL ldap://cool.ldap.server/dc=bob,dc=com?uid</p>

<p>AuthLDAPBindDN &ldquo;cn=admin,dc=bob,dc=com&rdquo;</p>

<p>AuthLDAPGroupAttribute memberUid</p>

<p>AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN off</p>

<p>AuthLDAPBindPassword <your_bind_password></p>

<p>Satisfy any</p>

<p></Directory></p>

<p>This simple change (after an Apache restart) should give your Apache server security over that directory, authenticating against LDAP.  Since your LDAP store is POSIX compliant for login, you have a few other things you can leverage in there as well.  Among those, are the &ldquo;Group&rdquo; field.  That&rsquo;s right, instead of going out and adding individuals and/or preventing them, you can specify an entire class of people (say LDAP_Logins for instance) that if the user belongs to that group, suddenly they have access to anything that is authenticating against LDAP.</p>

<p>To add that ability, you can add groups to the stanza above like so:</p>

<p>Require ldap-group cn=mygroup,ou=Group,dc=bob,dc=com</p>

<p>Require ldap-attribute gidNumber=500</p>

<p><em>(you place your group number in place of the &ldquo;500&rdquo; above)</em></p>

<p>Now that you have the magic behind LDAP auth for Apache, you can add this to any Apache web server of the 2.x variety, and do your security centrally.</p>

<p>The ease of addition for new users on your network is now as simple as adding the user to your LDAP store, placing them in the appropriate group.  Once Apache was restarted the very first time to make this work, you never have to restart it for user additions.  It will simply query LDAP, and LDAP will provide the credential response Apache needs to continue forward.</p>

<p>Next time:  Sudoers in LDAP!</p>

<p>The best-selling HD Player (as known as Netflix Player by Roku) plays High Definition video and connects to surround sound audio.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.roku.com/roku-products">Roku HD Player</a></p>

<p><strong>Roku Outstanding, Content Scarce</strong></p>

<p>By <strong>cvquesty</strong> from <strong>Atlanta, GA</strong> on <strong>12/29/2009</strong></p>

<p>4out of 5</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>High quality picture, Reliability, Great value, Easy to use, Easy to set up</p>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Want more video choices</p>

<p><strong>Best Uses: </strong>Primary TV</p>

<p><strong>Describe Yourself: </strong>Movie buff, Netflix fan, Technophile, Early adopter, Power User</p>

<p>We are on the verge of eliminating Cable TV, thanks to Roku. The only problem left is the dearth of programming choices. There are MANY more online video and audio networks out there all primed and ready to be carried by the likes of a Roku. Give me more programming, and I&rsquo;ll go with you all the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now you should have a functional LDAP server, a properly configured client, and the ability to authenticate against your server.  However, the last couple &ldquo;cogs in the wheel&rdquo; are left to manage.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, when you add a user in UNIX-land, part of the process of the adduser command also sets their shell, creates a home directory for them and so forth.  As you may notice, there is no particular method to make this happen in Linux-LDAP.  You just have a store and a tool to manage the store.</p>

<p>Have no fear, it&rsquo;s PAM to the rescue.</p>

<p>As we said in our first installment, the following packages are all that is necessary to have the basic plumbing of LDAP to work:</p>

<p>openldap</p>

<p>openldap-servers</p>

<p>openldap-clients</p>

<p>openldap-devel</p>

<p>While that is true, there are a couple more packages that put the finishing touches on this to make it sing.  Those are:</p>

<p>nss
nss_ldap
nscd</p>

<p>NSS is a glibc mechanism or interface allowing access to the common UNIX databases such as the password or hosts database.  It is most commonly used to provide an interface to both local /etc/passd and /etc/shadow files and usually for the purposes of interfacing with LDAP or NIS.</p>

<p>NSS_LDAP is a set of C library extensions which allows X.500 and LDAP directory servers to be used as a primary source of name service information such as users, hosts, groups, and other such data historically managed via local flat files or a NIS infrastructure.</p>

<p>NSCD is a name services caching daemon that provides a cache for the most common name requests.  While useful in speeding up response to queries, nscd has it&rsquo;s own set of problems.  I&rsquo;ll cover only some of it&rsquo;s usefulness, and you should circumspectly determine whether you will need caching at all based on your organization&rsquo;s size and the size of your serving infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Home Directories</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, to make the login process as pleasurable/smooth an experience as possible, there are some things that we generally do in standard administration practices that ease the user&rsquo;s experience.  Namely, we setup a standard set of configuration and environment files to provide a consistent user experience of the shell.  These are usually their home directory files such as:</p>

<p>.bashrc
.bash_profile
.bash_logout
.vimrc
.mozilla</p>

<p>Usually these are handled in the usual way via the useradd command, which also copies one of everything from the /etc/skel directory to your user&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>As you can see, simply adding a user to the LDAP store would not give occasion for this to happen.  PAM to the rescue!  PAM contains a module that is their &ldquo;mkhomedir&rdquo; module.  Depending on your architecture, this lives in the /lib or the /lib64 directories under &ldquo;security&rdquo;:</p>

<p>/lib/security/pam_mkhomedir.so
/lib64/security/pam_mkhomedir.so</p>

<p>What these modules do when properly invoked is on the first connection of a user that is validated as a proper user/password combination via LDAP, PAM sees that they have no home directory, and <em>creates the home directory for them just as if you, the administrator had created it with the <strong>adduser </strong>script.</em></p>

<p>This, by far, is one of the handiest modules provided by PAM.</p>

<p><strong>Turning on the PAM</strong></p>

<p>To turn on the mkhomedir facility for your servers and clients, simply do the following:</p>

<p>In /etc/pam.d there are a number of configuration files for handling login defs for varying circumstances.  What we are interested in is <em>system-auth</em>.  System-auth is also sourced by the sshd option, so this will work for both console logins and ssh/remote logins.</p>

<p>The last stanza of the system-auth configuration file is the &ldquo;session&rdquo; section.  On the second-to-last line between the pam_unix and pam_ldap designations, add the following:</p>

<p>session     required     pam_mkhomedir.so</p>

<p>This is a keyword set that tells Linux to load up and perform the functions offered by the pam_mkhomedir module.  Now, whenever you connect to a system configured in this way, it will automatically create the user&rsquo;s skel information and change ownerships to the proper settings so the user can login.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>You may note that I also referred to using group-based security.  In LDAP/PAM-land, this is just as simple as the above PAM setup.  Look into the individual system&rsquo;s /etc/security directory for a file called access.conf.  This file allows you to grant/deny access to individual users, groups, and also where they can connect to this machine from.  The syntax is clearly explained in the file itself, but here&rsquo;s an example.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I only want root, wheel, and the admins group to be able to access a certain system.  let&rsquo;s say they can access this system from anywhere.  Now let&rsquo;s say I also want the backup group to access the same system, but only from one host.  The setup is quite simple.  First, let&rsquo;s allow complete access to the people we wish to be able to connect from everywhere.  At the end of the /etc/security/access.conf file, add the following line:</p>

<p>+: root wheel admins : ALL</p>

<p>This tells the system to add access for root, wheel, and admins from ALL hosts.  Now, let&rsquo;s put in those backup admins, but only allow them to connect from the host we want them to come from:</p>

<p>+: backup : 10.1.10.10</p>

<p>This means the backup group can access this host, but only from the host 10.1.10.10.  There are many other methods of allowing and denying access in this file.  The documentation is contained within the file, so feel free to look through it for more information.</p>

<p>The MOST important line is the last line, however.  After you&rsquo;ve setup all the people you WANT to access the system, that does no good if all access is still left on for everyone, everywhere.  The final line in the file should be to deny all access to anyone else not specified above, and would look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>: ALL : ALL</li>
</ul>


<p>Simply stated, this removes (or subtracts) all access for ALL other users from ALL other hosts.  This line is evaluated last after the preceding lines are, and will take the preceding lines into account when setting up it&rsquo;s rules in memory.</p>

<p>At the very worst, if you mis-order the lines here, you may not be able to login to the system and will need to boot to single-user mode and then use the article here on this site entitled &ldquo;A Neat Trick&rdquo; to make /etc read/write so you can change the configuration and then reboot back into your system&rsquo;s default runlevel, but if you&rsquo;re careful, this will be quite easy to configure and manage.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a few things I left out, and I will be revising this series at some point in time to allow for any omissions I&rsquo;ve made.  I will also be adding in feature suggestions and will be following this up with a sudo article so you can overlay the &ldquo;on-box&rdquo; security set you&rsquo;d like to see happen in your environment <em>after</em> your LDAP infrastructure is in place.</p>

<p>Feel free to drop me a note if you see anything amiss, and I&rsquo;ll be sure to correct it and give you props.</p>
