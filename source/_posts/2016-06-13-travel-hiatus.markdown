**Out**

Just a quick update for you all. $work decided at some point that one of the things I was specifically hired for (blogging in the community) some sort of way "gives away the farm" in regards to Puppet, Puppet Consultation, and related items. As such, I've been asked not to blog publicly regarding items we deliver as services.

:-(

It likely doesn't matter that much, as I'm travelling more than I have in years, and am on-target to exceed 145k miles by Summer's end.  As a result, I will be laying off until I can regroup and find more time.

Sorry, but as they say "them's the breaks".

If you need me, you can always find me on the Puppet community Slack Channel #puppet, and my nick there is @cvquesty.

Look for interesting news from me soon.
