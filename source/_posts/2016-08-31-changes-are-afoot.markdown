After much thought and consideration, I've terminated my employ with ShadowSoft. I was travelling nearly every week all over the US, and not with my family as much as I'd like. Unfortunately, this role was a 70% travel role, and our youngest needed Daddy home.

As luck would have it, a totally awesome telecommute FT/Perm option came up with PayPal, and I accepted rather excitedly, and began that role today.  After some getting acquainted with my new duties, you should be seeing/hearing more from me soon.
