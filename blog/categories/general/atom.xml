    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After much thought and consideration, I&rsquo;ve terminated my employ with ShadowSoft. I was travelling nearly every week all over the US, and not with my family as much as I&rsquo;d like. Unfortunately, this role was a 70% travel role, and our youngest needed Daddy home.</p>

<p><img src="http://cvquesty.github.io/images/paypal.png" alt="PayPal" /></p>

<p>As luck would have it, a totally awesome telecommute FT/Perm option came up with PayPal, and I accepted rather excitedly, and began that role today.  After some getting acquainted with my new duties, you should be seeing/hearing more from me on the Puppet front soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Out</strong></p>

<p>Just a quick update for you all. $work decided at some point that one of the things I was specifically hired for (blogging in the community) some sort of way &ldquo;gives away the farm&rdquo; in regards to Puppet, Puppet Consultation, and related items. As such, I&rsquo;ve been asked not to blog publicly regarding items we deliver as services.</p>

<p>:-(</p>

<p>It likely doesn&rsquo;t matter that much, as I&rsquo;m travelling more than I have in years, and am on-target to exceed 145k miles by Summer&rsquo;s end.  As a result, I will be laying off until I can regroup and find more time.</p>

<p>Sorry, but as they say &ldquo;them&rsquo;s the breaks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you need me, you can always find me on the Puppet community Slack Channel #puppet, and my nick there is @cvquesty.</p>

<p>Look for interesting news from me soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so first let&rsquo;s cover the gobbledygook.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of feedback on various parts of the blog here, and I thought I&rsquo;d address a few of them here.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Why didn&rsquo;t you just point at the appropriate Yum repos for installing Puppet?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Easy.  I can do &ldquo;yum install foo&rdquo; and never know what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes just like anyone.  My goal here was to give a point-by-point installation guide so those who are interested could know what all the moving parts were and how they fit together.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Why are you using the dashboard and not Foreman?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Also easy&hellip; at least at the time of this writing, The Foreman has been indicated to be the next front end to be the &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; standard, but as for right now, the Enterprise Console is essentially a turbocharged version of the Dashboard.  As such, when I begin to talk about extending the Enterprise Console, Dashboard would be the analogue by which you can most obtain the same experience (short of installing Puppet Enterprise itself).</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Why OSS and not PE?</strong></p>

<p>A:  Well, to be frank&hellip; PE is about as simple as you can get.  You can learn a bit about what portions to install and how to connect them all together across machines (something I plan to cover), and you can learn about constructing an answer file (or several for a large, complex installation),  but the vast majority of your PE installations will be a Q/A interaction with the installer.</p>

<p><strong>Workflows and Tools</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest changes in how I deal with Puppet has been my adoption of and implementation of workflows as well as using some modern tools I&rsquo;ve been made aware of by the Puppet Labs folks.  Among these are Vagrant, r10k, GitHub, and many others that work together and are tightly integrated and require a lot of configuration and setup to &ldquo;make happen&rdquo;.  I intend to cover those here.</p>

<p>So, what are all these things?</p>

<p><strong>Vagrant</strong></p>

<p>Vagrant is a tool that allows you to pre-configure a small virtualized environment on your host consisting of a Puppet Master and any number of agents for use in a dynamic, iterative fashion.  By bringing up a Vagrant environment, I have a miniature development environment from which I can actually test Puppet code I write in a full PE environment and work out kinks you don&rsquo;t normally encounter when working independently on a single workstation.  From this environment, I can puppet-lint check all my code and then push all that code out of the Vagrant environment up to GitHub, then pull it down to my production instance as needed.  Further, it allows me to simulate all environments I have in my corporate setup (DEV, PROD, TEST, etc.) and commit those differences to the appropriate branches in GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>r10k</strong></p>

<p>The method by which I iterate, push/pull code and deploy to various environments both in my Vagrant instance and in my Production site is via r10k.  A leap forward past &ldquo;puppet librarian&rdquo;, r10k is the glue that ties between GitHub and Vagrant as well as your GitHub instance and your Corporate site.  This can tie to public GitHub as well as Corporate (private) GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong></p>

<p>GitHub is considerably more well known, but it&rsquo;s important to the whole process as you can read above.  GitHub is a revision control repository designed for rapid deployment, iteration, and isolated developer work with periodic pushes back to GitHub. (distributed development).  I intend to do a simple tutorial on GitHub as well.</p>

<p>Look forward to piece-by-piece coverage of each of these and my thoughts as I prepare for and take the Puppet Labs Certification test.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A Few Notes...]]></title>
    <link href="http://questy.org/blog/2011/02/22/a-few-notes/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-22T10:26:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://questy.org/blog/2011/02/22/a-few-notes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it is important to make a note about all of the people and places that have helped me ferret out a lot of this configuration.  I don&rsquo;t find this stuff in a vacuum (like anything in the Open Source world), and find it quite important to give a nod where a nod is due.</p>

<p>First, to <a href="http://www.turner.com">Turner Broadcasting</a> who gave me my first shot at doing this in a relatively small environment.  There was a ton of time spent on the phone, in online forums, reading documentation, and the like.  Everything sort of proceeded from there.  I tried to get such a thing into the backend over at <a href="http://www.weather.com">The Weather Channel</a>, but the climate wasn&rsquo;t right, and there was a great deal of change going on.  Trying to implement such a thing there just wouldn&rsquo;t have worked out very well.</p>

<p>Next, to <a href="http://www.incomm.com">Incomm</a>.  They needed a solution, and Brock (my boss) gave me ample time to get a lot of this together, and to do it right without interruption.  Big thanks there.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, my best bud <a href="mailto:johnbeamon@yahoo.com">John Beamon</a>.  He encountered and worked with LDAP long before I did.  And, while we have considerably different directories in place between our two mutual organizations, his help in putting together how all this works in my head has been invaluable.  I daresay I&rsquo;ve been into his IM client twice (or more) often as he&rsquo;d like, gave him props nowhere near as much as I should (like at all), and even with all his own work on his plate, he has helped me out immeasurably.  Add to that, he&rsquo;s a long-time friend and fellow-minister, and that&rsquo;s just good times right there.  They don&rsquo;t come along like John very often, and I&rsquo;m grateful to have him as both a friend and fellow nerd.</p>

<p><strong>Kudos, JB!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s still some inaccuracies here, and I&rsquo;ll be sifting through all this as I continue to build and extend OpenLDAP in this environment.  Things will automagically correct before your eyes, most likely.  If you find anything that happens to scream &ldquo;No!&rdquo; to you, feel free to drop me a line, and I&rsquo;ll be happy to make that change.</p>

<p>HappyLDAPping!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.roku.com/roku-products">Originally submitted at Roku</a></p>

<p>The best-selling HD Player (as known as Netflix Player by Roku) plays High Definition video and connects to surround sound audio.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.roku.com/roku-products">Roku HD Player</a></p>

<p><strong>Roku Outstanding, Content Scarce</strong></p>

<p>By <strong>cvquesty</strong> from <strong>Atlanta, GA</strong> on <strong>12/29/2009</strong></p>

<p>4out of 5</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>High quality picture, Reliability, Great value, Easy to use, Easy to set up</p>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Want more video choices</p>

<p><strong>Best Uses: </strong>Primary TV</p>

<p><strong>Describe Yourself: </strong>Movie buff, Netflix fan, Technophile, Early adopter, Power User</p>

<p>We are on the verge of eliminating Cable TV, thanks to Roku. The only problem left is the dearth of programming choices. There are MANY more online video and audio networks out there all primed and ready to be carried by the likes of a Roku. Give me more programming, and I&rsquo;ll go with you all the way.</p>

<p>I <em>might</em> even pay a monthly subscription if you can get Hulu or Boxee or some other content market deal.</p>
